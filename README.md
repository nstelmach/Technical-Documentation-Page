# Technical Documentation FreeCodeCamp

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/BapgaVq](https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/BapgaVq).

The goal of this project was to learn HTML and CSS. I focused on building a technical documentation page. I was supposed to use tags such as main, section, header, p, code, li, nav, a and the corresponding id and classes. I also used media query. In the future, I plan to refactor styles into classes using BEM naming convention, use CSS Reset and increase accessibility by adding appropriate aria labels.
